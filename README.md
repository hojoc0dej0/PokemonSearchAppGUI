  <p> This is one of the main projects I used to gain a certificate in JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. In this interactive project, I utilize the following skills:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dynamic Data Retrieval: Using Asynchronous JavaScript to fetch API data</li>
    <li>User Interface Updates: Adding dynamic functionality to the DOM for each user request</li>
    <li>Input Validation & Error Handling: Using advanced regex to filter out invalid Pokemon names and prompt users to correct their input/li>
  </ul>
